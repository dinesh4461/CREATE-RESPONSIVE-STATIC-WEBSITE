				<h2 class="heading">NARUTO</h2>
				<img src="maxresdefaultNar.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: 50%;">
				<p>Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story
					of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
					Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts—the first set in Naruto's pre-teen
					years, and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri
					(1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the
					following year, and Naruto (1997).

					Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, with
					its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series
					produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of
					the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the
					original series, premiered in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was
					broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to
					Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The
					English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime
					series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March
					2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve
					original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video
					games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

					Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their
					digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada
					in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most
					OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters.
					The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations:
					Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

					Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 250 million copies in circulation
					worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million copies in Japan alone and remaining 97
					million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English
					translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list
					several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's
					character development, strong storylines, and well-executed action sequences, though some felt the
					action sequences slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age
					theme, makes use of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.</p>

					second season of the anime series aired from October 2021 to February 2022. It featured one original
					episode, re-edited the Mugen Train film into six episodes, and then covered the "Entertainment
					District" arc from the manga in 11 episodes. A compilation film, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – To
					the Swordsmith Village, was released in February 2023 while a third season covering the "Swordsmith
					Village" arc is set to premiere in April 2023.

					By February 2021, the manga had over 150 million copies in circulation, including digital versions,
					making it the ninth best-selling manga series of all time. Also, it was the best-selling manga in
					2019 and 2020. Both the manga and its anime adaptation have received critical acclaim. The anime
					series has received numerous awards and is considered one of the best anime of the 2010s. In 2020,
					the Demon Slayer franchise generated an estimated annual sales revenue of ¥1 trillion ($8.75
					billion), becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.</p>
